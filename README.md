# Kepler

## Overview
It is a machine learning project designed to classify cosmic objects using machine learning techniques. This project leverages Jupyter Notebook for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Features
- Preprocessing of cosmic object data
- Implementation of a machine learning model
- Evaluation and visualization of classification results

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ronak_jat/cosmic-classifier.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd cosmic-classifier
   ```
3. Install dependencies manually:
   ```sh
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn seaborn
   ```
4. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```

Usage

Open the cossmic_classifier_cogni2047565.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook.

Follow the structured workflow:

Step 1: Load and preprocess data – Clean, normalize, and split the dataset.

Step 2: Train the model – Configure and train a deep learning classifier.

Step 3: Evaluate the model – Analyze performance metrics.

Step 4: Make predictions – Use the trained model to classify new cosmic data.
